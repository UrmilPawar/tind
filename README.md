# TinDog
- This Project was a part of our PMKVY training which involves creating a Tinder-like website for Dogs. The idea was to learn various Bootstrap concepts.
- Various Bootstrap components like Carousel, Card, Buttons, Navbar etc were used. 
- HTML5, CSS3, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome were also used to build the website.
- The website is responsive.
